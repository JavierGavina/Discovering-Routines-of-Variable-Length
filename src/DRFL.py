"""
Discovering Routines of Fixed Length.

This script allows to discover routines of fixed length in a time series. The algorithm is based on the paper "An incremental algorithm for discovering routine behaviors from smart meter data" by Jin Wang, Rachel Cardell-Oliver and Wei Liu.

The algorithm is based on the following steps:

    * Extract subsequences of fixed length from the time series.
    * Group the subsequences into clusters based on their magnitude and maximum absolute distance.
    * Filter the clusters based on their frequency.
    * Test and handle overlapping clusters.

The algorithm is implemented in the class DRFL, which has the following methods and parameters:

The parameters:
    * m: Length of each secuence
    * R: distance threshold
    * C: Frequency threshold
    * G: magnitude threshold
    * epsilon: Overlap Parameter

Public methods:
    * fit: Fit the time series to the algorithm.
         Parameters:
            - time_series: Temporal data.
    * show_results: Show the results of the algorithm.
    * get_results: Returns the object Routines, with the discovered routines.
    * plot_results: Plot the results of the algorithm.
        Parameters:
            - title_fontsize: `Optional[int]`. Size of the title plot.
            - ticks_fontsize: `Optional[int]`. Size of the ticks.
            - labels_fontsize: `Optional[int]`. Size of the labels.
            - figsize: `Optional[tuple[int, int]]`. Size of the figure.
            - xlim: `Optional[tuple[int, int]]`. Limit of the x axis with starting points.
            - save_dir: `Optional[str]`. Directory to save the plot.

        """
        Test and handle overlapping clusters by determining the significance of their overlap.

        Overlapping clusters are analyzed to decide if one, both, or none should be kept based on the overlap
        percentage and the clusters' characteristics. This determination is crucial for maintaining the
        quality and interpretability of the detected routines. The method employs a two-step process: first,
        it calculates the number of overlapping instances between the two clusters; then, based on the overlap
        percentage and the clusters' properties (e.g., size and magnitude), it decides which cluster(s) to retain.

        Parameters:
            * cluster1: `Cluster`. The first cluster involved in the overlap test.
            * cluster2: `Cluster`. The second cluster involved in the overlap test.
            * epsilon: `float`. A threshold parameter that defines the minimum percentage of overlap required for considering an overlap significant. Values range from 0 to 1, where a higher value means a stricter criterion for significance.

        Returns:
            * tuple[bool, bool]: A tuple containing two boolean values. The first value indicates whether
                                 cluster1 should be kept (True) or discarded (False). Similarly, the second
                                 value pertains to cluster2.


        Overview of the Method's Logic:
            * Calculate the number of instances in cluster1 that significantly overlap with any instance in cluster2.
            * determine the significance of the overlap based on the 'epsilon' parameter: if the number of overlaps exceeds 'epsilon' times the smaller cluster's size, the overlap is considered significant.
            * In case of significant overlap, compare the clusters based on their size and the cumulative magnitude of their instances. The cluster with either a larger size or a greater cumulative magnitude (in case of a size tie) is preferred.
            * Return a tuple indicating which clusters should be kept. If the overlap is not significant, both clusters may be retained.

        Note:
            * This method relies on private helper methods to calculate overlaps and compare cluster properties.
            * The method does not modify the clusters directly but provides guidance on which clusters to keep or discard.
